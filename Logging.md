## Note

Remember to log all activity for reporting purposes. Take screenshots of everything, even if your attempts fail. I like to number my screenshots `1 - blah.png` to make it easer to review screenshots when creating the report storyboard. You should be including positive findings for the client in your report Executive Summary and Storyboard sections.

## Linux/Mac Bash prompt

If you're logging commands, (and you should be) you should also include the date, time, and your IP address in your logs.

Put this in your .bashrc (Linux) or .bash_profile (Mac):

```
PS1='[`date  +"%d-%b-%y %T"`]\[\033[01;31m\] `ifconfig eth0 2>/dev/null | sed -n 2,2p | cut -d" " -f 10`\[\033[00m\] \[\033[01;34m\]\w\[\033[00m\] \$ '
alias script='script -f $HOME/$(date +"%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S")_shell_script.log'
```

Replace 'eth0' with the correct network interface if different.

## Linux screenshot utility:

Shutter is arguably the best screenshot utility for Linux systems.

Installation: `sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y shutter libgoo-canvas-perl`

## Windows screenshot utility

Greenshot: https://getgreenshot.org/

Greenshot is a light-weight screenshot software tool for Windows with the following key features:

* Quickly create screenshots of a selected region, window or fullscreen; you can even capture complete (scrolling) web pages from Internet Explorer.
* Easily annotate, highlight or obfuscate parts of the screenshot.
* Export the screenshot in various ways: save to file, send to printer, copy to clipboard, attach to e-mail, send Office programs or upload to photo sites like Flickr or Picasa, and others.
* ...and a lot more options simplyfying creation of and work with screenshots every day.

## Linux Logging Examples:

Log using tee:

`command args | tee output.log`

Append to a log:

`command args | tee -a output.log`

Log all commands run in a window using the script utility: 

`script output.log`

Run a single command and log it using the script utility:

`script -c 'command args' output.log`

If your command requires single quotes in the args, wrap the command in double quotes or vice versa. You can also escape quotes.

Metasploit spool command:

`msf> spool msfconsole.log`

## Windows Logging Examples:

`Get-ChildItem -Path D: -File -System -Recurse | Tee-Object -FilePath "c:\test\AllSystemFiles.txt" -Append | Out-File c:\test\NewSystemFiles.txt`

This command saves a list of system files in two log files, a cumulative file and a current file.

The command uses the Get-ChildItem cmdlet to do a recursive search for system files on the D: drive. A pipeline operator (|) sends the list to Tee-Object, which appends the list to the AllSystemFiles.txt file and passes the list down the pipeline to the Out-File cmdlet, which saves the list in the NewSystemFiles.txt file.

Tee-Object works the same when running Dos commands in PowerShell.
