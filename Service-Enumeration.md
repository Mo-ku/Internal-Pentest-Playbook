## Common vulnerable ports to scan:

UDP Ports: 53,69,111,161,500,623,2049

TCP Ports:  21,22,23,25,53,80,81,88,110,111,123,137-139,161,389,443,445,500,512,513,548,623-624,1099,1241,1433-1434,1521,2049,2483-2484,3268,3269,3306,3389,4333,4786,4848,5432,5800,5900,5901,6000,6001,7001,8000,8080,8181,8443,10000,16992-16993,27017,32764

## Very fast: Masscan can quickly scan a large network. Common masscan options:

`masscan -p <ports> --open --banners -oG <outputfile> -iL <inputfile>`

## Nmap scan of common vulnerable ports

`nmap -sS -sV -p 21,22,23,25,53,80,81,88,110,111,123,137-139,161,389,443,445,500,512,513,548,623-624,1099,1241,1433-1434,1521,2049,2483-2484,3268,3269,3306,3389,4333,4786,4848,5432,5800,5900,5901,6000,6001,7001,8000,8080,8181,8443,10000,16992-16993,27017,32764 --open -oA scans/nmap-tcp -iL targets.txt`

## Nmap UDP scan: 

`nmap -sU -p 53,69,111,161,500,623,2049 --open -oA scans/nmap-udp -iL targets.txt`

-When you have nmap scan results from a very large network, it helps to import the xml files into Sparta (installed by default on Kali). Sparta allows you to view results by host or service, and if you use sshuttle to proxy traffic through the PTK, you can right click on object in Sparta and run default nmap scripts against a service, brute-force the service using a GUI, http screenshot, take notes, and more.

## Enumerate HTTP/S Services

`cat scans/nmap-tcp.xml | aquatone -nmap -ports xlarge -out aquatone`

Review Aqutone report. Check for printers with LDAP connections and hijack the credentials. Check for default credentials and vulnerable versions.

## Test for open SMTP Relay

```
msfconsole
use auxiliary/scanner/smtp/smtp_relay
set RHOSTS <IP or File>
set MAILFROM <PoC email address>
set MAILTO <your email address>
run
```
